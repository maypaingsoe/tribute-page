    <p>Edvard Munch is best known as being a <strong> Norwegian born, expressionist painter, and printer</strong>. He was <em> born in Oslo, Norway in December 12, 1863 </em>. Only a few years after he was born, Edvard Munch's mother died of tuberculosis. His childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family. In 1879, Munch enrolled in a technical college to study engineering, but in the following year, he left the college to become a painter.</p>
    <p>In 1881, Munch enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design. Many of Munch's works depict life and death scenes, love and terror, and the feeling of loneliness was often a feeling which viewers would note that his work patterns focused on. These emotions were depicted by the contrasting lines, the darker colors, blocks of color, somber tones, and a concise and exaggerated form, which depicted the darker side of the art which he was designing. The Scream ("The Cry"; 1893), is one of his iconic and best known artworks.</p>
    <p>Edvard Munch spent his last two decade in isolation by painting landscapes then <em>passed away in 1944</em>, in his hometown, Oslo.</p>
